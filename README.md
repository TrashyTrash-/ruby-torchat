torchat - the Ruby implementation
=================================
You can find the official implementation [here](https://github.com/prof7bit/TorChat).

This aims to be a Ruby implementation and daemon to deal with a TorChat session even from
outside or with other languages without having to implement the whole thing.

The main target is supporting TorChat in bitlbee.
